        <h1>About RocHack</h1>
        <p class="indent">
        RocHack started with a Facebook thread about posting GitHub profiles. Shortly
        after, <a href="http://www.simonmweber.com">Simon Weber</a>, <a href="#">Sean Brennan</a>, <a href="https://andrewdwong.com">Andrew Wong</a>, <a href="#">Nate Book</a>, <a href="http://celehner.com/">Charles Lehner</a>, and <a href="#">Steve Gattuso</a> met up in person for the very first RocHack meeting (which ended up being all of them sitting in a room ranting about technology) in September of 2012.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
        Since then, RocHack has grown and had events such as Hacker Nights and our first Hackathon in December 2013.

        <h3>Get in touch</h3>
        <p class="indent">We love meeting new people!

        <h3>The family</h3>
        <p class="indent">The one and only requirement to becoming a member of the RocHack family is that you must learn enough about Git and HTML to add your name to this list. </p>

        <p class="indent">Anyone who comes to us with no programming knowledge will be taught how to do this as their first project, as it's a super simple way to get started with the two tools.</p>
